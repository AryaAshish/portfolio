# Personal Journey

I'm Ashish Aryan, a Senior software Engineer based in Bengaluru, India. I build scalable mobile applications and backend systems that solve real-world problems.

## Early Days

I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering from College of Technology & Engineering, Udaipur in 2020. My journey in Android development started with a passion for creating intuitive mobile experiences and has evolved into building enterprise-grade applications that serve millions of users.

## Career Path

My career has been a journey of continuous learning and impact:

**At Velotio Technologies** (2024 - Present), I'm working on cutting-edge audio technology, building the DTS Play-Fi App that delivers premium wireless audio experiences across 17+ languages. I've also led development of spatial computing applications for Android XR devices, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on mobile platforms.

**At Delhivery** (2021 - 2024), I transformed internal tools into public-facing marketplaces, architected multi-app systems with offline-first capabilities, and built reusable component libraries that accelerated development across teams. Working closely with backend teams, I contributed to Go microservices and event-driven architectures that handle high-volume logistics workflows.

**At Alyve Health** (2021), I migrated legacy applications to modern MVVM architecture, reducing technical debt and setting the foundation for faster development cycles.

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Building for scale**: Architecture that grows with the product, not against it
- **Offline-first thinking**: Applications that work seamlessly, even when connectivity is poor
- **Code quality over velocity**: Sustainable development practices that pay dividends long-term
- **Full-stack understanding**: Knowing both mobile and backend helps build better systems
- **Continuous learning**: Technology evolves, and so should we

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- **Riding my BMW G 310 GS** through the mountains and countryside of India
- **Traveling** across India, exploring new places and cultures
- **Writing poetry** and tech blogs, sharing thoughts and experiences
- **Staying fit** through regular workouts
- **Planning my next scuba diving adventure** - working towards becoming an advanced diver

Life beyond code makes me a better engineer. The perspective gained from travel, the patience learned from long bike rides, and the creativity sparked by writing all influence how I approach problems and build solutions.
