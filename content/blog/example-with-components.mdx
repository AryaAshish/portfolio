# Diving at Neil's Island

This is an example blog post that demonstrates how you can use interactive storytelling components in your MDX blog posts.

## The Journey Begins

I started my journey to the Andaman Islands with excitement and anticipation. The crystal-clear waters were calling.

<JourneyMap 
  location="Neil's Island, Andaman"
  coordinates={[11.8, 92.7]}
  type="dive"
  date="2024-01-15"
/>

## The Dive Experience

The dive at Bus Stop dive site was absolutely breathtaking. Here's my dive log:

<DiveLog 
  site="Bus Stop, Neil's Island"
  location="Andaman Islands, India"
  depth={18}
  visibility={30}
  temperature={28}
  duration="45 minutes"
  highlights={["Lionfish", "Parrotfish", "Coral garden", "Bannerfish", "Clownfish"]}
  date="2024-01-15"
/>

## Code from the Road

While traveling, I often code from different locations. Here's something I built while at a beach cafe:

<CodeFromLocation 
  location="Goa Beach Cafe"
  date="2024-02-10"
  language="typescript"
>
{`// Code written while traveling
export function journey() {
  const experiences = []
  const memories = []
  
  return {
    experiences,
    memories,
    adventure: true
  }
}`}
</CodeFromLocation>

## Motorcycle Journey

After the diving trip, I took a motorcycle ride through the mountains:

<RideRoute 
  from="Port Blair"
  to="Havelock Island"
  distance={120}
  duration="3 hours"
  stops={["Wandoor Beach", "Chidiya Tapu"]}
  date="2024-01-16"
/>

## Location Highlights

<LocationCard 
  name="Neil's Island Bus Stop Dive Site"
  coordinates={[11.8, 92.7]}
  date="2024-01-15"
  type="dive"
  narrative="The most beautiful dive site I've experienced. The coral formations were pristine, and the marine life was abundant. Swimming through schools of fish felt like being in an underwater ballet."
/>

Here's a summary of my travel journey so far:

<JourneyStats
